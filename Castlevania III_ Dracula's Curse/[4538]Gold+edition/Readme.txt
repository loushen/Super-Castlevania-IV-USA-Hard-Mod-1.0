Castlevania 3 Gold Edition

This Romhack is out for a while and is available as v2.00 here:
https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=84673

I did get a version of Level-engine himself. All I did to it was playing and I fixed one sprite pointer and removed the debugger modus.
Since I believe that one will confuse people more then it will be a improvement. And when you like it just add it back with reVamp. (Check-box on emulation tab)
Level-engine seems not to care to share it on RHDN but I think it would get much more attention there so I decided to try and upload it there.
I personally have a long history to fail uploades on this side but hey this hack deserves it more then the crap I had in mind to upload sometimes.

A word from levelengine (the author of the romhack/remix):

If you were looking for a romhack of Castlevania 3 Dracula's Curse, then you've come to the right place!
After roughly two months of brainstorming and building, I've successfully remixed Castlevania 3 into something different, but it still does have a lot of the 
old content unchanged, as the level editor (reVamp) is limited and Castlevania romhacking is largely unexplored.
Fair warning that this game is difficult just like the American version of Castlevania 3 that it was built off of.
