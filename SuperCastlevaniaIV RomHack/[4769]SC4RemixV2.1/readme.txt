		Hello Beloved CV4 Fans!
		
==About the hack:==

This is a remix hack that changes the enemy type in the levels, Music and Vertical/Horizontal progression in the last two stages. 
This is not possible in the editor right now but might be added on some point. Very view tables in the ROM had to be changed.
Also added minor code to disable fatal damage on some spike types and added one mode 7 effect. This hack was aimed to be created in minimal time. 
I did manage to keep my goal to release it within two weeks.. but this been busy weeks and the hack has a lot to over in form of new game play. 

There are a view level layout changes to fresh things up and give a good challenge. 
The difficulty is aimed for normal player that look for a third quest for the game since the orginal is to easy. 

If you know CV4 very well then try the double boss health patch.
That one will do what it says and adjust small stuff along the way.
Like sub-weapons get balanced to be all useful. This patch can be used on the original game too. Or other hacks where you like 
to add a extra challenge.



==Version 2.0:==
- Added a different palette for Simon.
- Added a reworked Run Patch. 
	Press A to run.
	Hold L to moonwalk.

Vitor Vilela made a patch to make the slowROM to a fastROM and the change is magificant increase in read speed what will get rid of a lot of lag.

Different other touch-ups 


==Version 1.x:==
- A patch with a compatible version of don't move is added for people who love it.
- Repalced some autospaner events with normal spawns.

	
==Needed tools and files to a play the hack:==

A ips patcher like this one: https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1040/
Or a better xDelta patcher like here: https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/704/

==Known Bugs:==
- There are additional checkpoint used for game overs. When the game calculates the PW for that location it will not work. Use PW lists of the normal game!
- Don't move patch does not work with run patch. I am aware and I recommend not to use this patch and just press and hold the jump button after you whip. Very easy..
- The enemy pointers are mixed up not actually reworked. This is why some stuff looks a little off. For me it is not worth the time to make it perfect.
- The auto-spawner routines of the original game are a bit hyperactive. Would probably be worth to rework this routines.
- I know a lot of small stuff but I just call the features. If something is game breaking let me know.
