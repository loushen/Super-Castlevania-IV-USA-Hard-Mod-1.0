2. About this Hack
-------------------------
This is a complete hack of Super Castlevania IV. With a very view graphicle changes.
It has new levels and a new power-up that let’s you move in ways not seen before, opening new shortcuts and pathways.
Other Castle is a bit more challenging than the original game. Prepare for these new challenges if you play the normal game.

The main focus is level design. Other Castle lets you explore Castlevania IV all over again. 
Learn a lot more about Dracula and Simon. Those who survive Other Castle once, more pain awaits on the 2nd loop 

- who can become the hero for this challenge?

Version 0.9
The hack resived some updates in the past but got to a point where I lose intresst to put more time into.
What is left to do is costomize the story. I was also thinking of tweaking the bosses here but I might do that in my next project.
Also I don't have the skills and I need to learn a lot to get it to that point where I would call it finished.
